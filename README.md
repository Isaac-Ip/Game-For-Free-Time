# Game For Free Time

It's just a game for free time. 
This game is playable at: [LINK HERE](https://isaac-ip.github.io/Game-For-Free-Time/)

Ver. 1.1.0
Created base game, movements, loadup.
Base game: Just the website creation.
Movements: WASD for movement, will make shooting soon.
Loadup: The screen popup when loading the game.

Ver. 1.2.0
Created enemy spawning, shooting bullets, reloading.
Enemy spawns: Will follow you, until you shoot it down.
Shooting: Click your mouse is pressing the trigger. EASY
Reload animation: 15 bullets, when used magazine on character will disappear and reappear when ready.

Will make visuals. 
Hoping to make a UI for upgrading the gun.
Will also make enemies kill you. For now you are invincible

Ver. 1.2.1
Patched spinning bullets
Patched reloads: reloading won't freeze you in place anymore

Ver. 1.3.0
⬆️ Buffed Reload Speed: 2 -> 1.5
⬇️ Nerfed Accuracy: Bullets now spray

Ver. 1.3.1
Patched a glitch where if you move first before reloading once, the game freezes.

Discovered hitbox glitch with the player, as it doesn't follow the player rotation.
This is being fixed, but might just become a FEATURE!!!!! (yea idk)

Ver. 1.4.0
Reworked hitbox. This one bug needed so much to fix I count it as a minor update.
Changed coding physics: Arcade Physics -> Matter Physics
This change was required to fix the hitbox.
If updates aren't happening very quickly, it is because of infamiliarity with Matter. Sorry guys.

Ver. 1.4.1
Fixed collision and spawning. Bug caused spawning to be in the corners. Collision just didn't happen.
Death still doesn't happen. Working on it.
Might add recoil to the game. (fixed as an upgradeable part)
⬆️ Buffed Accuracy: Bullets will not spray anymore until upgrades are made.
⬇️⬇️ Nerfed Reload Speed (for now): 1.5 -> 3

Starting to rework upgrade UI. It will soon be built in with keybinds to prevent taking breaks in the game (unless I add a pause function ofc)


MORE TO COME SOON!
