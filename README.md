# Game For Free Time

It's just a game for free time.<br>
This game is playable at: [LINK HERE](https://isaac-ip.github.io/Game-For-Free-Time/)

Ver. 1.1.0<br>
Created base game, movements, loadup.<br>
Base game: Just the website creation.<br>
Movements: WASD for movement, will make shooting soon.<br>
Loadup: The screen popup when loading the game.

Ver. 1.2.0<br>
Created enemy spawning, shooting bullets, reloading.<br>
Enemy spawns: Will follow you, until you shoot it down.<br>
Shooting: Click your mouse is pressing the trigger. EASY<br>
Reload animation: 15 bullets, when used magazine on character will disappear and reappear when ready.

Will make visuals. <br>
Hoping to make a UI for upgrading the gun.<br>
Will also make enemies kill you. For now you are invincible

Ver. 1.2.1<br>
Patched spinning bullets<br>
Patched reloads: reloading won't freeze you in place anymore

Ver. 1.3.0<br>
⬆️ Buffed Reload Speed: 2 -> 1.5<br>
⬇️ Nerfed Accuracy: Bullets now spray

Ver. 1.3.1<br>
Patched a glitch where if you move first before reloading once, the game freezes.

Discovered hitbox glitch with the player, as it doesn't follow the player rotation.<br>
This is being fixed, but might just become a FEATURE!!!!! (yea idk)

Ver. 1.4.0<br>
Reworked hitbox. This one bug needed so much to fix I count it as a minor update.<br>
Changed coding physics: Arcade Physics -> Matter Physics<br>
This change was required to fix the hitbox.<br>
If updates aren't happening very quickly, it is because of infamiliarity with Matter. Sorry guys.

Ver. 1.4.1<br>
Fixed collision and spawning. Bug caused spawning to be in the corners.<br> Collision just didn't happen.<br>
Death still doesn't happen. Working on it.<br>
Might add recoil to the game. (fixed as an upgradeable part)<br>
⬆️ Buffed Accuracy: Bullets will not spray anymore until upgrades are made.<br>
⬇️⬇️ Nerfed Reload Speed (for now): 1.5 -> 3

Starting to rework upgrade UI. It will soon be built in with keybinds to prevent taking breaks in the game (unless I add a pause function ofc)


MORE TO COME SOON!
