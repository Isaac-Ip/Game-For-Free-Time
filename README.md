# Game For Free Time

It's just a game for free time.<br>
This game is playable at: [LINK HERE](https://isaac-ip.github.io/Game-For-Free-Time/)

Ver. 1.1.0<br>
Created base game, movements, loadup.<br>
Base game: Just the website creation.<br>
Movements: WASD for movement, will make shooting soon.<br>
Loadup: The screen popup when loading the game.

Ver. 1.2.0<br>
Created enemy spawning, shooting bullets, reloading.<br>
Enemy spawns: Will follow you, until you shoot it down.<br>
Shooting: Click your mouse is pressing the trigger. EASY<br>
Reload animation: 15 bullets, when used magazine on character will disappear and reappear when ready.

Will make visuals. <br>
Hoping to make a UI for upgrading the gun.<br>
Will also make enemies kill you. For now you are invincible

Ver. 1.2.1<br>
Patched spinning bullets<br>
Patched reloads: reloading won't freeze you in place anymore

Ver. 1.3.0<br>
⬆️ Buffed Reload Speed: 2 -> 1.5<br>
⬇️ Nerfed Accuracy: Bullets now spray

Ver. 1.3.1<br>
Patched a glitch where if you move first before reloading once, the game freezes.

Discovered hitbox glitch with the player, as it doesn't follow the player rotation.<br>
This is being fixed, but might just become a FEATURE!!!!! (yea idk)

Ver. 1.4.0<br>
Reworked hitbox. This one bug needed so much to fix I count it as a minor update.<br>
Changed coding physics: Arcade Physics -> Matter Physics<br>
This change was required to fix the hitbox.<br>
If updates aren't happening very quickly, it is because of infamiliarity with Matter. Sorry guys.

Ver. 1.4.1<br>
Fixed collision and spawning. Bug caused spawning to be in the corners.<br> Collision just didn't happen.<br>
Death still doesn't happen. Working on it.<br>
Might add recoil to the game. (fixed as an upgradeable part)<br>
⬆️ Buffed Accuracy: Bullets will not spray anymore until upgrades are made.<br>
⬇️⬇️ Nerfed Reload Speed (for now): 1.5 -> 3

Starting to rework upgrade UI. It will soon be built in with keybinds to prevent taking breaks in the game (unless I add a pause function ofc)

Ver. 1.5.0<br>
Changed my mind, upgrade UI is now an entirely different screen.<br>
Upgrades cost 50 bolts, but have a 50% chance to work (chance of upgrade actually happening).<br>
Players now have 3 hp, each enemy deals 1 hp.<br>
Enemies now have 5 hp, each bullet dealing 1 hp.<br>
Enemies now have a 'damaged' skin.<br>
Enemies drop 3-7 bolts when killed. Bolts can be used to upgrade.<br>
Enemies now have a 10% chance to two enemies on death.<br>
This might not seem like much, but over time, it adds up to a lot.


4 new upgrades have been added.<br>
FIRERATE reduces the time of each bullet being shot: 0.1s -> 0.08s -> 0.6s -> 0.04s -> 0.02s<br>
RELOAD reduces the time for reloading the magasines: 3s -> 2.25s -> 1.5s -> 0.75s -> 0.25s<br>
SPRAY reduces the spray range of the bullets. 20 degree spray ->>>> 0 degree spray<br>
AMMO increases the amount of bullets that can be shot before reloads: 6 -> 15 -> 30 -> 100 -> 1000

Ver. 1.6.0<br>
Added a new upgrade, critical hits and armored enemies.<br>
CRIT increases crit chance: 5% -> 10% -> 15% -> 20% -> 30%<br>
Red bullets will deal 3 crit damage. If you don't know if it hit, then try to find the crit particles.<br>
Enemies now have a 20% chance of spawning as a armored enemy, having 15 hp and drops 8-14 bolts.

Ver. 1.7.0<br>
Created new classes! Yay.<br>
Total 6 new classes.<br>
Normal: The original player, no buffs.<br>
Frank: 2 starter drones. <font color="#ff0000">This class is for gametesters only.</font><br>
Brice: Slower, larger, and no recoil but gains 200 hp. <font color="#ff0000">This class is for gametesters only.</font><br>
Tracker: Has homing bullets, you cannot possibly miss now.<br>
Brokie: Gets 2x bolts. Become rich I guess.<br>
Hunter: Does double base and crit damage. Crit will kill normal enemies with one shot.

The Frank and Brice classes have specific upgrades to their class.<br>

Frank<br>
Drone Dmg upgrades drone damage: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5<br>
Drone Firerate decreases the time between shots: 1s ->>>> 0.05s<br>
Drone Count increases the number of drones by 1: 2 drones ->>>> 8 drones

Brice<br>
Healing increases the healing per second: 0.4hp -> 0.8hp -> 1.2hp -> 1.6hp -> 2hp<br>
Defence decreases the amount of damage taken: 0% dmg reduction ->>>> 50% dmg reduction

Ver. 1.7.1<br>
Fixed a bug where the Brice class didn't heal and showed a lot of decimals when taking damage with upgraded defence.
Fixed a bug where the Tracker bullets didn't home.
Fixed a bug where the Frank drones would deal damage to the player.
